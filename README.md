# TAP! 🐱‍👓  by remuechat

TAP! Or "Tic-tac-toe Array Practice" is a python console game of tic tac toe. Will integrate ML and advanced algorithms later. I made this project to practice array manipulation and basic neural networks. Run the first cell of code (jupyter notebook) to run the game! Good luck! 🎉

FUTURE UPDATE:
1. Recorded gameplay - the games will be recorded
1. "Against computer" difficulty - you can play against the computer!
